          <h2 className="mb-2 font-bold">About This Tool</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This tool is for <strong>endgame players</strong> optimizing their starship layouts for maximum efficiency. It is most effective if you:
          </p>
          <ul className="mb-4 infodialog__list">
            <li>
              <strong>Have most or all slots unlocked</strong> in your starship.
            </li>
            <li>
              Have access to <strong>all technology upgrades</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Possess a <strong>full set of three upgrade modules</strong> per applicable technology.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If youâ€™re still unlocking slots or gathering upgrades, the tool can still offer insights but is primarily intended for{" "}
            <strong>fully equipped and upgraded ships</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mb-2 font-bold">Basic Usage</h2>
          <ul className="mb-4 infodialog__list">
            <li>
              <strong>Click or tap</strong> a cell to toggle its <em>Supercharged</em> state (max 4).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ctrl-click or long press</strong> to enable/disable individual cells.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the <strong>row activation buttons</strong> on the right to enable/disable entire rows. These buttons are disabled once modules are placed,
              until you press <strong>Reset Grid</strong>.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="mb-2 font-bold">Solving Times and Quality</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When you have open supercharged slots, the tool will use a <strong>Simulated Annealing</strong> algorithm to attempt to find the best placement.
            These solves typically take around <strong>20 seconds</strong> and are usually the best available <strong>98% of the time</strong>.
          </p>
          <ul className="mb-4 infodialog__list">
            <li>
              <strong>Quality of Solves:</strong> The longer the algorithm runs, the better the quality of the solve, but there is a{" "}
              <strong>hard limit of 30 seconds</strong> for each attempt to prevent excessive processing time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Occasional Issues:</strong> On rare occasions, the simulated annealing solve may return results that are obviously questionable. If that
              happens, simply <strong>re-run the solve</strong> for a better solution.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Simulated annealing with also kick in if you attempt to place technology but lack space for a proper solve on the grid. It will simply attempt to
            give you the best solution it can find.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mb-2 font-bold">Upgrade Modules & Scoring</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Upgrade modules are labeled <strong>Sigma, Tau, and Theta</strong> (visible via tooltips). To maximize in-game scoring:
          </p>
          <ul className="mb-4 infodialog__list">
            <li>
              <strong>Sigma</strong> should be the best upgrade available.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Theta</strong> should be the weakest.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="mb-2 font-bold">Tips for Multi-Tech Layouts</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            For <strong>Square or L-shaped supercharged layouts</strong> across multiple technology types:
          </p>
          <ul className="mb-4 infodialog__list">
            <li>
              <strong>Activate only a few supercharged slots</strong> and solve for the first technology.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Then activate the remaining supercharged slots</strong> and solve for the next technology.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">This ensures all technologies benefit from an optimized layout without interfering with prior solves.</p>

          <h2 className="mb-2 font-bold">How the Optimizer Works</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">The optimizer figures out the best module layout for your ship by following these steps:</p>
          <ol className="mb-4 infodialog__list">
            <li className="infodialog__list-item">
              <strong>Tries a known best layout:</strong> If there's a recommended setup for your tech, it tests that pattern in different positions
              and rotations to find a best fit.
            </li>
            <li className="infodialog__list-item">
              <strong>Optimizes around supercharged slots:</strong> If your ship has available, unused supercharged slots, it tries to make the most of them by reworking the pattern to maximize power.
            </li>
            <li className="infodialog__list-item">
              <strong>Falls back on smart searching:</strong> If no preset layout fits or works better, it uses a custom algorithm to search for a strong
              arrangement from scratch.
            </li>
            <li className="infodialog__list-item">
              <strong>Makes sure everything fits:</strong> It double-checks that all your selected modules are placed and working together properly.
            </li>
            <li className="infodialog__list-item">
              <strong>Gives you the best result:</strong> It shows you the highest-scoring layout it found, along with how close it is to a perfect score.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>In short:</strong> The optimizer tests smart layouts first, tweaks them for extra potentual, and uses advanced logic if needed to give you the
            strongest possible setup.
          </p>
