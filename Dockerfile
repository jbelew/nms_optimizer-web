# 1) Copy only manifests + config so install is fast
COPY package.json package-lock.json tsconfig.json vite.config.ts ./

# 2) Install deps but skip scripts (so we donâ€™t try to build before source exists)
RUN npm ci --ignore-scripts

# 3) Copy in your full source tree
COPY . .

# 4) Run the build now that src/, tsconfig.json, etc. are present
