# Initial Concept
A Web UI for a No Man's Sky technology layout optimization tool. It optimizes technology layouts by calculating pattern-based scores, prioritizing supercharged slots using game-tested configurations, and ensuring the best fit within the grid.

# No Man's Sky Technology Layout Optimizer (Web UI)

## Product Vision
To provide a high-performance, accurate, and user-friendly web application that empowers No Man's Sky players to optimize their technology layouts for maximum adjacency bonuses and efficiency, specifically leveraging supercharged slots.

## Target Audience
- **Casual Players:** Looking for quick, effective layout suggestions to improve their gameplay without deep manual experimentation.
- **Min-Maxing Veterans:** Dedicated players seeking the absolute highest possible bonuses through precise, mathematically-backed optimizations.

## Core Goals
- **Precise Calculation:** Calculate and display absolute maximum adjacency bonuses for any technology set.
- **Automated Optimization:** Automatically suggest optimal layouts tailored to the user's specific supercharged slot arrangement.
- **Performance Excellence:** Deliver a fast algorithm (under 5s) and maintain top-tier Core Web Vitals for a seamless web experience.

## Key Features
- **Grid Management:** Interactive grid with support for various supercharged slot patterns and manual slot toggling.
- **Technology Library:** A comprehensive database of technologies across all equipment types (Starship, Multi-tool, Exosuit, etc.).
- **Real-time Feedback:** Visual feedback and scoring as users interact with the grid.
- **Persistence & Sharing:** Multi-channel sharing and saving via URL encoding, browser local storage, and JSON export/import.

## Success Metrics
- **Accuracy:** Layouts consistently match or exceed community-discovered "god-tier" configurations.
- **Speed:** Optimization algorithm completes in < 5 seconds for most common configurations.
- **Core Web Vitals:** Maintain "Good" ratings (LCP, FID/INP, CLS) to ensure a high-quality user experience.
