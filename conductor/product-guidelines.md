# Product Guidelines: No Man's Sky Technology Layout Optimizer

## Tone and Voice
- **Helpful and Accessible:** Instructions and guidance should be clear and supportive, ensuring that both new players and veterans feel empowered by the tool.
- **Immersive and Thematic:** The language should evoke the *No Man's Sky* universe, using thematic phrasing like "Initializing Search," "Signal Detected," or "Optimization Matrix Stable."

## Visual Identity
- **High-Contrast Sci-Fi:** The UI should feature dark backgrounds paired with vibrant, glowing accents (cyan, amber, magenta) to mirror the aesthetic of space-faring technology interfaces and the in-game menus.
- **Iconography:** Use clean, geometric icons that feel like part of a futuristic heads-up display (HUD).

## Prose Style
- **Action-Oriented:** Use direct, engaging verbs for calls to action, such as "Analyze," "Optimize," "Sync," and "Deploy."
- **In-Game Terminology:** Adhere strictly to the game's vocabulary (e.g., "Adjacency Bonus," "Supercharged Slots," "Nanites," "Procedural Upgrades") to ensure instant familiarity for players.

## Error Handling & Feedback
- **Contextual and Instructive:** Errors should not just state a problem but offer a solution (e.g., "System Conflict: Move hyperdrive modules to adjacent slots to activate bonus.").
- **Systemic & Diagnostic:** Frame feedback as "System Diagnostics" or "Incompatible Signature Detected" to maintain the immersive sci-fi atmosphere.

## Design Principles
- **Mobile Responsive:** The application is designed primarily as a "second-screen" experience. Interfaces must be touch-friendly, with large hit areas and a layout that remains functional and readable on smartphones used during gameplay.
