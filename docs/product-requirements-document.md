# Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the No Man's Sky Technology Layout Optimizer AI (Web UI). This tool is a web-based application that allows users to optimize their technology layouts in the game No Man's Sky.

### 1.1. Purpose

The purpose of this product is to provide a user-friendly interface for the NMS Optimizer, a tool that calculates the optimal placement of technologies to maximize in-game bonuses.

### 1.2. Vision

The vision for this product is to become the go-to tool for No Man's Sky players who want to optimize their technology layouts. It should be easy to use, powerful, and provide a great user experience.

## 2. User Personas

### 2.1. The Min-Maxer

*   **Description:** This user wants to squeeze every last bit of performance out of their technology layouts. They are willing to spend time experimenting with different configurations to achieve the best possible results.
*   **Goals:** To create the most powerful and efficient technology layouts possible.
*   **Frustrations:** It is difficult and time-consuming to manually calculate the optimal placement of technologies.

### 2.2. The Casual Player

*   **Description:** This user wants to improve their technology layouts without spending a lot of time on optimization. They are looking for a tool that is easy to use and provides good results with minimal effort.
*   **Goals:** To quickly and easily improve their technology layouts.
*   **Frustrations:** They don't have the time or patience to manually optimize their layouts.

## 3. Features

### 3.1. Core Features

*   **Grid-based layout editor:** Allows users to place technologies on a grid that represents their in-game inventory.
*   **Technology selection:** Provides a list of available technologies for users to choose from.
*   **Optimization:** Sends the user's layout to the backend solver and displays the optimized layout.
*   **Supercharged slot support:** Allows users to designate slots as "supercharged" for enhanced bonuses.

### 3.2. Advanced Features

*   **Pattern-based scoring:** Uses a weighted scoring system to evaluate the effectiveness of different layouts.
*   **Simulated annealing and ML-driven solves:** Employs advanced algorithms to find the best possible layouts.
*   **Layout sharing:** Allows users to share their optimized layouts with other players.

## 4. User Flow

1.  The user arrives at the application.
2.  The user selects the type of inventory they want to optimize (e.g., starship, multitool).
3.  The user places their existing technologies on the grid.
4.  The user designates any supercharged slots.
5.  The user clicks the "Optimize" button.
6.  The application sends the layout to the backend solver.
7.  The application displays the optimized layout.
8.  The user can then save or share the optimized layout.

## 5. Out of Scope

*   **In-game stat calculation:** The tool will not calculate the exact in-game stats of a given layout. It will only provide a score based on its own weighting system.
*   **User accounts:** Users will not be required to create an account to use the tool.
