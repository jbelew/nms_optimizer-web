# Architecture Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architecture and design of the No Man's Sky Technology Layout Optimizer AI (Web UI). This tool is a web-based application that allows users to optimize their technology layouts in the game No Man's Sky.

## 2. Architectural Goals

*   **Scalability:** The architecture should be able to handle a large number of users and requests.
*   **Maintainability:** The code should be easy to understand, modify, and extend.
*   **Performance:** The application should be fast and responsive.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The frontend and backend should be decoupled to allow for independent development and deployment.

## 3. System Architecture

The system is composed of two main components:

*   **Frontend:** A single-page web application built with React, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Vite, and Radix UI.
*   **Backend:** A Python-based service that provides the optimization logic.

### 3.1. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a modern, component-based application that follows the latest best practices in web development. It is responsible for rendering the user interface, handling user input, and communicating with the backend service.

#### 3.1.1. Component Library

The application uses Radix UI for its component library. Radix UI provides a set of accessible, unstyled components that can be easily customized with Tailwind CSS.

#### 3.1.2. State Management

The application uses Zustand for state management. Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management library that is easy to use and understand.

#### 3.1.3. Build Tool

The application uses Vite as its build tool. Vite is a fast and modern build tool that provides a great developer experience.

### 3.2. Backend Architecture

The backend is a Python-based service that provides the optimization logic. It is responsible for receiving layout data from the frontend, running the optimization algorithms, and returning the optimized layout.

## 4. Data Flow

1.  The user interacts with the frontend to create a technology layout.
2.  The frontend sends the layout data to the backend service.
3.  The backend service runs the optimization algorithms.
4.  The backend service returns the optimized layout to the frontend.
5.  The frontend displays the optimized layout to the user.

## 5. Deployment

The frontend is deployed as a static website on Heroku. The backend service is also deployed on Heroku.
