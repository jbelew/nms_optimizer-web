			"instructions": "## Before You Begin\n\nThis tool is for **endgame players** optimizing their technology layouts for maximum efficiency. It is most effective if you:\n\n- Have most or all slots unlocked on your item.\n- Have access to all technology upgrades.\n- Possess a full set of three upgrade modules per applicable technology.\n\nIf you're still unlocking slots or gathering upgrades, the tool can still offer insights, but it is primarily intended for **fully equipped and upgraded items**.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n- **Click or tap** the ⚙️ button to select your Starship or Multi-tool type.\n- **Click or tap** a cell to toggle its _Supercharged_ state (a maximum of 4).\n- **Ctrl-Click / ⌘-Click (or long press on touchscreen devices)** to enable/disable individual cells.\n- Use the **row activation buttons** to enable/disable rows. These buttons are disabled once modules are placed, until you press **Reset Grid**.\n\n## Usage Tips\n\nSupercharged slots offer powerful bonuses, but they're fixed, so your strategy should focus on making the most of where they are. **Don't just click all four supercharged slots to match your ship's config.** Here's how to get the best results:\n\n- **Start with one technology** that aligns with two or three supercharged slots, like _Pulse Engine_, _Infra-Knife Accelerator_, _Pulse Spitter_, or _Neutron Cannon_. **Click those cells as supercharged**, then solve for it.\n- **Use remaining coverage** for a second priority like _Hyperdrive_, _Scanner_, or _Mining Beam_, then solve for that. Spreading bonuses often beats stacking one tech.\n- **Then focus on large modules**, like _Hyperdrive_ or _Starship Trails_, before space runs out.\n\nThis tool does the hard work — your job is to prioritize the right technologies for your play style.\n\nAs space tightens, **reset a few technologies** and solve in a different order. With a fully spec’d ship, you may end up with just one slot left.\n\n## Pro-Tip\n\nThere’s real **math** behind placement, but **if it’s not working**, try marking a few cells as **disabled** to guide the solve toward a better layout.",
			"about": "## Overview\n\nThis web application provides an interactive interface for optimizing technology layouts in the game _No Man's Sky_, specifically for starships, multi-tools, and freighters. The tool focuses on identifying the **best tech layouts** by maximizing adjacency bonuses and leveraging supercharged slots—core strategies for achieving the **best starship layout**, **best multi-tool layout**, or **best freighter layout**.\n\n## How It Works\n\n> How do you solve a problem with 479 million possible permutations in under 5 seconds?\n\nThe optimization process blends deterministic patterns with adaptive algorithms tailored to No Man's Sky technology module grids:\n\n1. **Pattern-Based Pre-Solve:** Begins with a curated library of hand-tested layout patterns, optimizing for maximum adjacency bonuses across different grid types.\n2. **AI-Guided Placement (ML Inference):** If a viable configuration includes supercharged slots, the tool invokes a TensorFlow model trained on 16,000+ grids to predict optimal placement.\n3. **Simulated Annealing (Refinement):** Refines the layout through stochastic search—swapping modules and shifting positions to boost adjacency scoring while avoiding local optima.\n4. **Result Presentation:** Outputs the highest-scoring configuration, including score breakdowns and visual layout recommendations for starships, multi-tools, and freighters.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Grid-Aware Solving:** Accounts for supercharged and inactive slots when determining the **best layout configuration**.\n- **TensorFlow ML Inference:** Predicts optimal technology placement based on historical grid data.\n- **Simulated Annealing:** Improves layout quality by exploring configuration shifts and adjacency-based swaps.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend:** TypeScript, React, Zustand, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI  \n**Backend Solver:** Python, Flask, TensorFlow, NumPy, custom simulated annealing implementation, and heuristic scoring  \n**Testing:** Vitest, Python Unittest  \n**Deployment:** Heroku (Hosting) and Cloudflare (DNS and CDN)  \n**Automation:** GitHub Actions (CI/CD)  \n**Analytics:** Google Analytics\n\n## Repositories\n\n- Web UI: [nms_optimizer-web](https://github.com/jbelew/nms_optimizer-web)\n- Backend: [nms_optimizer-service](https://github.com/jbelew/nms_optimizer-service)\n\n## Some Fun History\n\nHere's a look at an **early version** of the UI—functionally solid but visually minimal. The current version is a major upgrade in design, usability, and clarity, helping players quickly find the **best layout** for any ship or tool.\n\n![Early prototype of No Man's Sky layout optimizer user interface](/assets/img/screenshots/screenshot_v03.png)",
			"translationRequest": "## Help Translate the NMS Optimizer\n\nThe app is currently English-only, but analytics show visitors from all over the world. I’d love to make it more accessible to the global No Man’s Sky community — and that’s where you come in.\n\n## How You Can Help\n\nI’m looking for bilingual players to help translate the app — especially into **French**, **German**, **Spanish**, and other languages with strong NMS player communities.\n\nYou don’t need to be a professional translator — just fluent, familiar with the game, and willing to help out. It'll definately be better than this ChatGPT mess! You’ll be credited (or remain anonymous if you prefer).\n\nMost strings are short UI labels, tooltips, or fun status messages like:\n\n- `Supercharging the layout!`\n- `Don’t worry, I know a guy!`\n- `Recalibrating supercharge node alignments!`\n\nTranslations are managed using [`i18next`](https://www.i18next.com/), with simple JSON files.\n\n## If You're Comfortable With GitHub\n\n**Fork the repo:**  \n   [github.com/jbelew/nms_optimizer-web](https://github.com/jbelew/nms_optimizer-web)\n\n**Translate:** \nUse `public/locales/en/translation.json` as your template.\nCreate a new folder for your language using the [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (e.g. `de` for German), and copy the file into that folder as `translation.json`. Then, update only the values (on the right-hand side); keep the keys exactly the same.\n\n> *Example:* Create `public/locales/de/translation.json` with translated values.\n\n**Submit a pull request** when you're done.\n\n## Not Into Pull Requests?\n\nNo problem — just head over to the [GitHub Discussions page](https://github.com/jbelew/nms_optimizer-web/discussions) and start a new thread.\n\nYou can paste your translations there or ask questions if you’re not sure where to begin. I’ll take it from there.\n\n## Notes\n\nSome longer strings (like the About dialog) are Markdown-formatted, but line breaks are stripped to make it valid JSON. If that makes them hard to read, paste the string into ChatGPT and ask it to restore the formatting. When done, you can ask ChatGPT to remove the line breaks so the content is valid JSON again (that's how I manage those strings).\n\n`randomMessages` is just that, a list of random messages that show when optimization takes longer than a couple of seconds. No need to translate them all, just come up with a few that make sense in your language.\n\nThanks for helping make the No Man's Sky Technology Layout Optimizer AI better for everyone! Let me know if you have any questions — happy to help."
