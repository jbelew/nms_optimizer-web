## Before You Begin

This tool is for **endgame players** optimizing their technology layouts for maximum efficiency. It is most effective if you:

- Have most or all slots unlocked on your item.
- Have access to all technology upgrades.
- Possess a full set of three upgrade modules per applicable technology.

If you're still unlocking slots or gathering upgrades, the tool can still offer insights, but it is primarily intended for **fully equipped and upgraded items**.

## Basic Usage

- **Click or Tap** the ⚙️ button to select your Starship or Multi-tool type.
- **Click or Double Tap** a cell to toggle its _Supercharged_ state (a maximum of 4).
- **Ctrl-Click / ⌘-Click or Single Tap on touchscreen devices)** to enable/disable individual cells.
- Use the **row activation buttons** to enable/disable rows. These buttons are disabled once modules are placed, until you press **Reset Grid**.

## Usage Tips

Supercharged slots offer powerful bonuses, but they're fixed, so your strategy should focus on making the most of where they are. **Don't just click all four supercharged slots to match your ship's config.** Here's how to get the best results:

- **Start with one technology** that aligns with two or three supercharged slots, like _Pulse Engine_, _Infra-Knife Accelerator_, _Pulse Spitter_, or _Neutron Cannon_. **Click those cells as supercharged**, then solve for it.
- **Use remaining coverage** for a second priority like _Hyperdrive_, _Scanner_, or _Mining Beam_, then solve for that. Spreading bonuses often beats stacking one tech.
- **Then focus on large modules**, like _Hyperdrive_ or _Starship Trails_, before space runs out.

This tool does the hard work — your job is to prioritize the right technologies for your play style.

As space tightens, **reset a few technologies** and solve in a different order. With a fully spec’d ship, you may end up with just one slot left.

## Pro-Tip

There’s real **math** behind placement, but **if it’s not working**, try marking a few cells as **disabled** to guide the solve toward a better layout.
