			"instructions": "[dev] ## Before You Begin\n\nThis tool is for **endgame players** optimizing their technology layouts for maximum efficiency. It is most effective if you:\n\n- Have most or all slots unlocked on your item.\n- Have access to all technology upgrades.\n- Possess a full set of three upgrade modules per applicable technology.\n\nIf you're still unlocking slots or gathering upgrades, the tool can still offer insights, but it is primarily intended for **fully equipped and upgraded items**.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n- **Click or tap** the ⚙️ button to select your Starship or Multi-tool type.\n- **Click or tap** a cell to toggle its _Supercharged_ state (a maximum of 4).\n- **Ctrl-Click / ⌘-Click (or long press on touchscreen devices)** to enable/disable individual cells.\n- Use the **row activation buttons** to enable/disable rows. These buttons are disabled once modules are placed, until you press **Reset Grid**.\n\n## Usage Tips\n\nSupercharged slots offer powerful bonuses, but they're fixed, so your strategy should focus on making the most of where they are. **Don't just click all four supercharged slots to match your ship's config.** Here's how to get the best results:\n\n- **Start with one technology** that aligns with two or three supercharged slots, like _Pulse Engine_, _Infra-Knife Accelerator_, _Pulse Spitter_, or _Neutron Cannon_. **Click those cells as supercharged**, then solve for it.\n- **Use remaining coverage** for a second priority like _Hyperdrive_, _Scanner_, or _Mining Beam_, then solve for that. Spreading bonuses often beats stacking one tech.\n- **Then focus on large modules**, like _Hyperdrive_ or _Starship Trails_, before space runs out.\n\nThis tool does the hard work — your job is to prioritize the right technologies for your play style.\n\nAs space tightens, **reset a few technologies** and solve in a different order. With a fully spec’d ship, you may end up with just one slot left.\n\n## Pro-Tip\n\nThere’s real **math** behind placement, but **if it’s not working**, try marking a few cells as **disabled** to guide the solve toward a better layout.",
			"about": "[dev] ## Overview\n\nThis web application provides an interactive interface for optimizing technology layouts in the game _No Man's Sky_, specifically for starships, multi-tools, and freighters. The tool focuses on identifying the **best tech layouts** by maximizing adjacency bonuses and leveraging supercharged slots—core strategies for achieving the **best starship layout**, **best multi-tool layout**, or **best freighter layout**.\n\n## How It Works\n\n> How do you solve a problem with 479 million possible permutations in under 5 seconds?\n\nThe optimization process blends deterministic patterns with adaptive algorithms tailored to No Man's Sky technology module grids:\n\n1. **Pattern-Based Pre-Solve:** Begins with a curated library of hand-tested layout patterns, optimizing for maximum adjacency bonuses across different grid types.\n2. **AI-Guided Placement (ML Inference):** If a viable configuration includes supercharged slots, the tool invokes a TensorFlow model trained on 16,000+ grids to predict optimal placement.\n3. **Simulated Annealing (Refinement):** Refines the layout through stochastic search—swapping modules and shifting positions to boost adjacency scoring while avoiding local optima.\n4. **Result Presentation:** Outputs the highest-scoring configuration, including score breakdowns and visual layout recommendations for starships, multi-tools, and freighters.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Grid-Aware Solving:** Accounts for supercharged and inactive slots when determining the **best layout configuration**.\n- **TensorFlow ML Inference:** Predicts optimal technology placement based on historical grid data.\n- **Simulated Annealing:** Improves layout quality by exploring configuration shifts and adjacency-based swaps.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend:** TypeScript, React, Zustand, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI  \n**Backend Solver:** Python, Flask, TensorFlow, NumPy, custom simulated annealing implementation, and heuristic scoring  \n**Testing:** Vitest, Python Unittest  \n**Deployment:** Heroku (Hosting) and Cloudflare (DNS and CDN)  \n**Automation:** GitHub Actions (CI/CD)  \n**Analytics:** Google Analytics\n\n## Repositories\n\n- Web UI: [nms_optimizer-web](https://github.com/jbelew/nms_optimizer-web)\n- Backend: [nms_optimizer-service](https://github.com/jbelew/nms_optimizer-service)\n\n## Some Fun History\n\nHere's a look at an **early version** of the UI—functionally solid but visually minimal. The current version is a major upgrade in design, usability, and clarity, helping players quickly find the **best layout** for any ship or tool.\n\n![Early prototype of No Man's Sky layout optimizer user interface](/assets/img/screenshots/screenshot_v03.png)"
