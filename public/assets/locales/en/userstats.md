# NMS Optimizer Stats: Most Popular Technology Layouts

## User Statistics & Popular Layouts

This page aggregates data from NMS Optimizer users to reveal the most frequently supercharged technologies across different platforms. Whether you're planning your next build or looking for inspiration, these statistics showcase real community preferences and patterns.

## Understanding the Data

The charts below display aggregated user statistics from the last **28 days**, showing which technologies players most commonly optimize for **supercharged slots**. The data represents thousands of optimization sessions across three primary platform types:

- **Starship Technologies** - Including Standard, Sentinel, and Solar starship variants
- **Multi-Tool Technologies** - Covering Standard, Sentinel, Atlantid, and Staves multi-tools
- **Corvette Technologies** - The specialized corsair ships introduced in the **Omega** update

## What These Charts Mean

Each chart shows the relative popularity of different technologies when users choose to supercharge them. A larger slice means that technology was selected for supercharging more frequently by the community. This reflects:

1. **Meta Effectiveness** - Technologies that provide the highest performance boosts tend to cluster toward the top
2. **Player Preferences** - Combat-focused players prioritize different techs than exploration-focused ones
3. **Synergy Opportunities** - Some technologies pair particularly well with supercharging, making them natural choices

### Reading the Charts

- Technologies representing less than **2% of total selections** are grouped into the "Other" category to keep the charts readable
- Percentages appear on each slice when they represent at least 6% of the total
- Technology colors match those used throughout the optimizer for easy reference

## Why This Matters

Understanding community patterns can help inform your own build decisions:

- **Validation** - If a technology you're considering is popular, it's likely for good reason
- **Discovery** - Find technologies you might not have considered by seeing what others prioritize
- **Meta Shifts** - Watch how the data changes as the game evolves and new content releases
- **Build Variety** - Use this as a starting point, then customize based on your playstyle and specific needs

## Getting Started

Once you've reviewed the popular choices here, head to the [optimizer](/en) to create your own optimized build. You can:

1. Select your platform (Starship, Multi-tool, Corvette, Exosuit, or Exocraft)
2. Configure your **supercharged slots** and **active cells**
3. Run the solver to find your perfect layout

For detailed instructions on using the optimizer, visit the [instructions page](/en/instructions).

## Data Collection

This data is collected anonymously from optimization requests and does not include any personally identifiable information. It helps the NMS Optimizer community understand which technologies deliver the most value and informs future improvements to the solver algorithms.
