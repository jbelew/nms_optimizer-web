## Before You Begin

This tool is for **endgame players** optimizing technology layouts for maximum efficiency. It works best when you:

- Have most or all cells unlocked on your item.
- Have access to all technology upgrades.
- Possess a full set of three upgrade modules per applicable technology.

If you're still unlocking cells or gathering upgrades, the tool can still offer insights -- but it's primarily intended for **fully equipped and upgraded items**.

## Basic Usage

- **Click or tap** the ⚙️ button to select your **Technology** type.
- **Click or double-tap** a cell to toggle its **Supercharged** state (up to 4 per grid).
- **Ctrl-click** (Windows) / **⌘-click** (Mac) or **single tap** (on touchscreens) to enable or disable individual cells.
- Use the **row toggle buttons** to enable or disable entire rows. These are **disabled once modules are placed**, and re-enabled when you press **Reset Grid**.

> 💡 **Note:** Exosuits and Exocraft have fixed grid states — **Exocraft cells cannot be modified**, and **only disabling is allowed on Exosuits**.

## Usage Tips

Supercharged cells provide powerful bonuses, but they’re limited in number — so every placement counts. Your strategy should center on making the most of them. **Don't just blindly select four supercharged cells to match your in-game config.** For the best results:

- **Start with one technology** that aligns with your play style and makes the most of two or three supercharged cells — such as _Pulse Engine_, _Infra-Knife Accelerator_, _Pulse Spitter_, or _Neutron Cannon_. Mark those cells as supercharged, then solve.
- **Use the remaining supercharged cells** for a second priority tech like _Hyperdrive_, _Scanner_, or _Mining Beam_, and solve again. Spreading bonuses often beats stacking everything into one tech.
- **Then focus on techs with large module counts**, such as _Hyperdrive_ or _Starship Trails_, before contiguous space runs out.

This tool does the hard work -- your job is to **prioritize technologies** based on your play style.

As space gets tighter, you may need to **reset a few technologies** and solve in a different order, otherwise you risk getting the dreaded **"Optimization Alert"**. With a fully upgraded starship, you’ll often end up with just one open cell in the end -- or none at all if it’s an **Interceptor**.

## Pro Tip

There’s real math behind placement. The solver usually works within fixed windows based on how many modules a technology has and is generally successful at picking the best location without wasting space. If things aren’t working out though, try **disabling a few cells** to steer the solver toward a better layout window.
